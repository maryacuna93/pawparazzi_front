# Pawparazzi Frontend
Pawparazzi is a web app that allows users to upload images of dogs and our AI
will identify the breed of the dog in the image. This works by communicating
with our backend API [Pawparazzi](https://github.com/maryacuna93/pawparazzi)
The frontend is built with Streamlit and based on the Stanford and [Tsinghua
Dogs](https://cg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/ThuDogs/) Datasets.
